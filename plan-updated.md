# Detailed Implementation Plan for the Institutional Repository

This plan covers the development of an institutional repository for a law school with the following modules: video streaming with a custom sleek player, student writing assignment submissions, advocacy program content with event management, and a law review portal featuring real‐time collaborative editing and LLM-powered editorial insights (blue book source referencing, research validity, source reputation checks, and AI-generation detection). The solution will integrate AI features using providers such as Ollama, CodeLlama, LangChain Mistral, and PromptLayer.

**EMPHASIS ON STREAMLINED READABILITY**: All public and internal pages will prioritize clean typography, clear content hierarchy, and intuitive navigation for external users and non-authoritative internal members.
