# üîç How to Find Your MediaConvert Account-Specific Endpoint

## üéØ **THE PROBLEM**

You're in the MediaConvert console but can't see the account-specific endpoint. Here's exactly where to find it:

## üìç **STEP-BY-STEP LOCATION**

### **Method 1: From MediaConvert Main Page**

1. **Go to MediaConvert Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/
2. **Look for the left sidebar** - you should see:
   - Jobs
   - Job templates  
   - Output presets
   - Input presets
   - Queues
3. **Click on "Account"** in the left sidebar (or look for "Settings")
4. **Look for "API endpoint"** or "Account-specific endpoint"

### **Method 2: If You Don't See the Sidebar**

1. **Make sure you're in the right region** (us-east-1 recommended)
2. **Look at the top of the page** - there might be a banner or info box
3. **Check for any "Getting Started" or "Setup" sections**

### **Method 3: Alternative Way to Get Endpoint**

If you can't find it in the console, you can get it via AWS CLI or API:

**Using AWS CLI** (if you have it installed):
```bash
aws mediaconvert describe-endpoints --region us-east-1
```

**The endpoint will look like**:
```
https://abc123def.mediaconvert.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

## üö® **WHAT I SEE IN YOUR SCREENSHOT**

You're on the "Create job" page. The endpoint is usually shown on the main MediaConvert dashboard or account settings, not on the job creation page.

## üîß **ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION**

If you can't find the endpoint easily, I can modify the code to automatically discover it. Here's what we can do:

### **Option A: Auto-Discovery Code**

I can update the MediaConvert integration to automatically discover the endpoint using the AWS SDK:

```typescript
// This code automatically finds your account endpoint
const mediaconvert = new MediaConvertClient({ region: 'us-east-1' });
const endpoints = await mediaconvert.send(new DescribeEndpointsCommand({}));
const endpoint = endpoints.Endpoints[0].Url;
```

### **Option B: Try Default Endpoint**

For us-east-1, you can try this default pattern:
```
https://[your-account-id].mediaconvert.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

Where `[your-account-id]` is your 12-digit AWS account ID.

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Go back to MediaConvert main page**: Click "AWS Elemental MediaConvert" in the breadcrumb
2. **Look for "Account" or "Settings"** in the left sidebar
3. **If still not found**, let me know and I'll implement the auto-discovery solution

## üí° **EASIER SOLUTION**

Actually, let me just implement auto-discovery in the code so you don't need to find the endpoint manually. This is more reliable anyway.

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Help you find the endpoint in the console, or  
- **B)** Update the code to automatically discover the endpoint?

Option B is probably easier and more robust!
