 th# Implementation Plan

Optimize large video streaming performance and implement efficient hover previews for multi-gigabyte video files.

The current system experiences timeout issues with large videos (300MB to multi-GB) despite CloudFront integration. The streaming endpoint redirects large videos to CloudFront but still encounters timeouts, indicating issues with the streaming strategy, CloudFront configuration, and video delivery optimization. This implementation will establish a robust video streaming architecture that handles large files efficiently through adaptive streaming, proper CloudFront configuration, and optimized video processing.

## Types

Enhanced video streaming and preview system with adaptive bitrate support.

```typescript
// Enhanced video streaming types
interface VideoStreamConfig {
  quality: 'auto' | '240p' | '360p' | '480p' | '720p' | '1080p' | 'original';
  adaptiveBitrate: boolean;
  preload: 'none' | 'metadata' | 'auto';
  bufferSize: number;
}

interface VideoPreviewConfig {
  thumbnailCount: number;
  previewDuration: number;
  spriteSheetUrl?: string;
  webVttUrl?: string;
}

interface CloudFrontConfig {
  distributionId: string;
  domain: string;
  cacheBehaviors: {
    videos: string;
    thumbnails: string;
    previews: string;
  };
}

interface AdaptiveStreamingManifest {
  videoId: string;
  qualities: Array<{
    quality: string;
    url: string;
    bitrate: number;
    resolution: string;
  }>;
  thumbnails: {
    spriteSheet: string;
    webVtt: string;
    interval: number;
  };
}
```
