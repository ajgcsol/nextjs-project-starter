# ðŸŽ¬ Video Disappearing Issue - FIXED!

## Problem Identified
When users clicked "Prepare Video", the video would disappear after 3 seconds before they could click "Save Draft" or "Publish Now".

## Root Cause
In `src/components/VideoUploadLarge.tsx`, the `handlePrepareVideo` function had an automatic form reset after 3 seconds:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - PROBLEMATIC
setTimeout(() => {
  resetForm();
}, 3000);
```

This caused the video and form data to disappear automatically, preventing users from publishing their prepared videos.

## Solution Applied
**File Modified**: `src/components/VideoUploadLarge.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed automatic form reset** - The form no longer resets automatically after 3 seconds
2. **Manual reset only** - The form now only resets when:
   - User clicks "Cancel" button
   - User clicks "Remove File" button
   - User manually chooses to reset

**Updated Code**:
```javascript
// NEW CODE - FIXED
const handlePrepareVideo = () => {
  // ... video preparation logic ...
  
  // Show success message but DON'T reset the form automatically
  setUploadProgress({
    loaded: selectedFile.size,
    total: selectedFile.size,
    percentage: 100,
    stage: 'complete',
    message: 'Video prepared! Use "Save Draft" or "Publish Now" buttons below to upload.'
  });

  // Don't auto-reset the form - let the user manually reset or keep the video for publishing
  // The form will only reset when the user clicks "Cancel" or manually removes the file
};
```

## User Experience Improvement
âœ… **Before Fix**: 
- Click "Prepare Video" â†’ Video disappears after 3 seconds â†’ User frustrated

âœ… **After Fix**:
- Click "Prepare Video" â†’ Video stays prepared â†’ User can click "Save Draft" or "Publish Now" â†’ Success!

## Additional Fixes Applied
- Fixed TypeScript return type issues
- Ensured proper React component structure
- Maintained all existing functionality while removing the problematic auto-reset

## Testing
The fix has been deployed to production. Users can now:
1. Select a video file
2. Fill in metadata (title, description, etc.)
3. Click "Prepare Video"
4. **Video stays prepared indefinitely**
5. Click "Save Draft" or "Publish Now" to complete the upload
6. Video persists until user manually resets or removes it
