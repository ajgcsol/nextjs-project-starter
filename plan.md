# Detailed Implementation Plan for the Institutional Repository

This plan covers the development of an institutional repository for a law school with the following modules: video streaming with a custom sleek player, student writing assignment submissions, advocacy program content with event management, and a law review portal featuring real‐time collaborative editing and LLM-powered editorial insights (blue book source referencing, research validity, source reputation checks, and AI-generation detection). The solution will integrate AI features using providers such as Ollama, CodeLlama, LangChain Mistral, and PromptLayer.

## 1. Directory & File Structure Updates

- **Create New Dashboard Directory**  
  - New folder: `src/app/dashboard/`
  - New pages within this directory:
    - `video/page.tsx` – Video content management
    - `student-assignments/page.tsx` – Student writing assignments
    - `advocacy/page.tsx` – Advocacy programs and event posting
    - `law-review/page.tsx` – Law review submissions and collaborative editing

- **Create New Component Files**  
  - `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
  - `src/components/AssignmentForm.tsx`
  - `src/components/EventForm.tsx`
  - `src/components/CollaborativeEditor.tsx`

- **Create New API Route Files**  
  - `src/app/api/videos/upload.ts`
  - `src/app/api/assignments/submit.ts`
  - `src/app/api/events/create.ts`
  - `src/app/api/lawreview/analyze.ts`

- **Create New Library Files**  
  - `src/lib/aiService.ts` – For LLM feature integration  
  - `src/lib/websocket.ts` – For real-time collaborative editing

## 2. Module Implementation Details

### Video Streaming Module
- **UI (src/app/dashboard/video/page.tsx):**
  - Develop a modern page layout with a header "Video Content Management".
  - Implement a form with an `<input type="file">` for video upload.
  - Integrate the `VideoPlayer` component for preview.
- **Component (src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx):**
  - Use an HTML5 `<video>` element with custom play, pause, seek, volume, and fullscreen controls.
  - Attach `onerror` handlers to display fallback messages if the video fails to load.
- **API (src/app/api/videos/upload.ts):**
  - Accept POST requests (e.g., using multipart/form-data).
  - Validate video file type/size and handle errors via try/catch.

### Student Assignments Module
- **Page (src/app/dashboard/student-assignments/page.tsx):**
  - Build a clean interface using modern typography and spacing.
  - Embed the `AssignmentForm` component.
- **Component (src/components/AssignmentForm.tsx):**
  - Render a form with `<textarea>` for submission and a submit button.
  - Include client-side validation (non-empty content) and error display.
- **API (src/app/api/assignments/submit.ts):**
  - Process POST requests, validate input, and store data (simulate storage via SQLite/local persistence).

### Advocacy Programs & Event Posting Module
- **Page (src/app/dashboard/advocacy/page.tsx):**
  - Design a layout to post program content and list events.
  - Integrate the `EventForm` component.
- **Component (src/components/EventForm.tsx):**
  - Create a form with fields for title, date, and description.
  - Validate entries and display errors inline.
- **API (src/app/api/events/create.ts):**
  - Accept event details, run input validation, and store event data.
  
### Law Review Collaborative Editing Module
- **Page (src/app/dashboard/law-review/page.tsx):**
  - Layout the page with tabs or sidebar sections for different article sections (Introduction, Analysis, Conclusion, etc.).
  - Embed the `CollaborativeEditor` component.
  - Display a panel for LLM analysis outcomes (blue book references, article tenor, AI detection metrics).
- **Component (src/components/CollaborativeEditor.tsx):**
  - Implement a rich text editor (using a `<div contentEditable>` or `<textarea>`) for real-time editing.
  - Integrate with the WebSocket module (`src/lib/websocket.ts`) for real-time synchronization.
  - Add a “Submit for Analysis” button that triggers an API call to start LLM analysis.
- **API (src/app/api/lawreview/analyze.ts):**
  - Receive POST requests with article content.
  - Invoke functions in `aiService.ts` to:
    - Generate Bluebook style source references.
    - Analyze overall article tenor.
    - Check source reputation and compute AI-generation probability.
  - Handle and log errors gracefully.

### AI Integration (LLM-Powered Editorial Insights)
- **Library (src/lib/aiService.ts):**
  - Implement functions such as `analyzeArticle(content: string)`, `generateBluebookReferences(content: string)`, and `validateSources(content: string)`.
  - Use fetch to integrate with AI providers (Ollama, CodeLlama, LangChain Mistral, PromptLayer).
  - Read API keys and configuration from environment variables.
  - Use try/catch for robust error handling.
- **Real-Time Editing (src/lib/websocket.ts):**
  - Build a simple WebSocket client to connect to a chosen real-time service.
  - Handle connection open, message receipt, errors, and automatic reconnection.

## 3. UI/UX and Best Practices
- Use modern, clean layouts with ample typography, spacing, and color contrasts in all new pages.
- Avoid usage of external icon libraries; use text and styled buttons for control actions.
- Ensure all user inputs are validated on both client and server sides and display meaningful error messages.
- Preserve existing assets in `public/` and reuse the existing design system from `src/components/ui`.
- Update `globals.css` to include new styling rules that ensure visual consistency.
- Enhance the README.md with configuration instructions, environment variable setup (LLM keys, streaming service credentials), and usage guidelines.

---

## 4. Testing & Error Handling
- Write unit tests and manual curl commands for API endpoints:
  - Verify video upload response, student assignment submission, event creation, and law review analysis.
- Log errors on the server and show user-friendly error messages on the UI.
- Ensure graceful degradation (e.g., if the LLM API fails, display a fallback message and allow re-submission).
