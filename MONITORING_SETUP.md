# Video Streaming Monitoring Setup

## Overview
Comprehensive monitoring system for video upload and streaming functionality using CloudWatch and Datadog.

## Components Implemented

### 1. CloudWatch Integration (`src/lib/monitoring.ts`)
- **CloudWatchLogger**: Centralized logging to AWS CloudWatch
- **VideoStreamingMonitor**: Video-specific monitoring events
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Performance timing and metrics

**Features:**
- Automatic log group/stream creation
- Video request/success/error tracking
- Database operation monitoring
- Performance timing measurements

### 2. Datadog RUM Integration (`src/lib/datadog-client.ts`)
- **Real User Monitoring**: Frontend performance tracking
- **VideoAnalytics**: Video-specific event tracking
- **Error tracking**: Comprehensive error monitoring

**Features:**
- Upload progress tracking
- Stream performance monitoring
- User interaction tracking
- Error correlation and debugging

### 3. Integrated Monitoring (`src/app/api/videos/stream/[id]/route.ts`)
- Video request logging with metadata
- Performance measurement for database lookups
- Success/error tracking with response times
- Detailed error context for debugging

## Environment Variables Required

### CloudWatch (Server-side)
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Datadog (Client-side)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN=your_client_token
```

## Monitoring Capabilities

### Video Upload Tracking
- Upload initiation
- Progress milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Upload completion with timing
- Upload errors with context

### Video Streaming Tracking
- Stream requests with user metadata
- Database lookup performance
- Presigned URL generation timing
- Stream success/failure rates
- Error categorization and debugging

### Performance Metrics
- Database query performance
- S3 operation timing
- End-to-end request timing
- Error rates and patterns

## Dashboard Access

### CloudWatch
- Log Group: `/vercel/law-school-repository`
- Metrics: Custom video streaming metrics
- Alarms: Can be configured for error rates

### Datadog
- RUM Dashboard: Real user monitoring
- APM: Application performance monitoring
- Logs: Centralized log aggregation
- Alerts: Custom alerting rules

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Issue Detection**: Monitor video streaming health in real-time
2. **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in upload/streaming pipeline
3. **User Experience Tracking**: Monitor actual user interactions and performance
4. **Debugging Support**: Detailed error context for faster issue resolution
5. **Capacity Planning**: Usage patterns and performance trends

## Next Steps

1. Configure Datadog environment variables in Vercel
2. Set up CloudWatch dashboards for video metrics
3. Configure alerting rules for critical errors
4. Monitor performance baselines after deployment
5. Set up automated reports for video system health

## Testing the Monitoring

After deployment, monitoring will automatically track:
- Video upload attempts and success rates
- Streaming request patterns and performance
- Error rates and common failure points
- User interaction patterns with video content

The monitoring system provides comprehensive visibility into the video streaming infrastructure health and user experience.
