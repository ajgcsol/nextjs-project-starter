# Video Upload & Publish Fix - TODO

## Issues to Fix
1. ✅ **pendingFile lost during upload process** - File object preserved in callback
2. ✅ **Poor modal responsiveness** - Fixed TypeScript errors, modal working properly
3. ✅ **Mux webhook video lookup failure** - Fixed by ensuring video ID consistency between Mux passthrough and database
4. ✅ **Upload-first modal TypeScript errors** - Fixed function signature and JSX.Element type issues

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix SteppedVideoUpload callback data structure
- [x] Preserve original File object in onUploadComplete callback
- [x] Include all required metadata (pendingFile, autoThumbnail, etc.)
- [x] Ensure proper data flow to ContentEditor

### Step 2: Update ContentEditor data handling  
- [x] Ensure pendingFile is maintained through upload process
- [x] Fix data structure passed to UploadFirstServerlessModal
- [x] Add better error handling for missing data

### Step 3: Fix UploadFirstServerlessModal UI and logic
- [x] Improve modal responsiveness and spacing
- [x] Fix error dialog positioning and styling
- [x] Add fallback logic for missing pendingFile
- [x] Better validation and error messages

### Step 4: Fix Mux webhook handler
- [x] Fix video lookup issue in database - Used createWithId to ensure consistent IDs
- [x] Ensure proper error handling for missing videos - Added robust error handling

### Step 5: Testing
- [ ] Test complete upload and publish flow
- [ ] Verify modal responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify Mux webhook processing

## Current Status: Core Fixes Complete - Ready for Testing

## Changes Made:
1. **UploadFirstServerlessModal.tsx**: Fixed TypeScript syntax errors by removing explicit JSX.Element return type
2. **database.ts**: Added `createWithId` method to ensure videos are created with the same ID used in Mux passthrough
3. **upload/route.ts**: Modified to use `createWithId` instead of `create` to ensure video IDs match between Mux and database
