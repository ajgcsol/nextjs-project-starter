# üö® URGENT: Fix AWS Credentials in Vercel

The multipart upload is failing because AWS credentials are not configured in your Vercel deployment. Here's how to fix it:

## Option 1: Quick Fix via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Get Your AWS Credentials
1. Go to AWS Console ‚Üí IAM ‚Üí Users
2. Find your user (or create one if needed)
3. Go to "Security credentials" tab
4. Create access key if you don't have one
5. Copy both:
   - **Access Key ID** (starts with AKIA...)
   - **Secret Access Key** (long random string)

### Step 2: Add to Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `law-school-repository-...`
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = AKIA... (your access key)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = wJalrXUt... (your secret key)
AWS_REGION = us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME = law-school-repository-content
CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN = d24qjgz9z4yzof.cloudfront.net
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## Option 2: Command Line (Alternative)

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
vercel env add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
vercel env add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
vercel env add AWS_REGION
vercel env add S3_BUCKET_NAME
vercel env add CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN
```

## Option 3: Create AWS Infrastructure (If Needed)

If you don't have AWS set up yet:

```powershell
# Run the setup script
.\scripts\setup-aws-infrastructure.ps1
```

This will create:
- S3 buckets for video storage
- CloudFront distribution for fast delivery
- Proper IAM permissions

## Verify the Fix

After adding credentials and redeploying:

1. Go to your video upload page
2. Try uploading a large video (>100MB)
3. Should work without "Failed to initialize multipart upload" error

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Good practices:**
- Never commit AWS credentials to git
- Use environment variables in Vercel
- Create IAM user (don't use root account)
- Use minimal required permissions

‚ùå **Don't do:**
- Put credentials in code
- Use overly broad permissions
- Share credentials in chat/email

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting "Failed to initialize multipart upload"?
1. Check environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
2. Verify AWS credentials work: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
3. Check S3 bucket exists and has proper permissions
4. Ensure region matches between all services

### Need help with AWS setup?
- Follow `AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
- Run `.\scripts\setup-aws-infrastructure.ps1` for automated setup
- Check AWS documentation for IAM best practices

## Expected Result

After fixing credentials:
- ‚úÖ Large video uploads work
- ‚úÖ Multipart upload initializes successfully  
- ‚úÖ Videos stream without timeout
- ‚úÖ CloudFront delivers content fast

The core streaming timeout issue is already fixed in the code - this just enables the upload functionality!
