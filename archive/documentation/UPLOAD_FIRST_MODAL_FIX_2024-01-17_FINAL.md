# Upload-First Modal Fix - August 27, 2025, 8:47 PM EST - FINAL VERSION

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. **Video File Not Found**: ServerlessPublishModal tries to validate `contentData.metadata.pendingFile` but it's undefined during multipart upload
2. **Modal Too Small**: Current modal is not responsive and too small for mobile/tablet
3. **Wrong Workflow**: Modal tries to preview before upload instead of upload-first approach
4. **Missing Transcript Display**: Video pages don't show actual transcripts

## ROOT CAUSE:
The ContentEditor stores video file in `pendingFile` but the modal opens during multipart upload when the file reference might be lost or not properly passed.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. **Upload-First Workflow**: Change modal to upload video immediately, then process thumbnails/transcripts
2. **Responsive Design**: Make modal full-screen responsive (95vw x 95vh)
3. **Proper File Handling**: Wait for multipart upload completion before opening modal
4. **Real Transcript Integration**: Connect Mux transcription to video display

## FILES TO FIX:
- src/components/ServerlessPublishModal.tsx (MAIN FIX)
- src/app/videos/[id]/page.tsx (transcript display)
- src/components/ContentEditor.tsx (timing fix)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: IN PROGRESS
