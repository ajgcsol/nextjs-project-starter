# Infinite Loop Fix - Video Upload Issue

## Problem Identified

The system is stuck in an infinite loop trying to create video records with the same Mux Asset ID: `X8yXKy9w01BuPSJ5DFtQZW014EuA7bTJLuly2IUlwuTvs`

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Query Issue**: The `findByMuxAssetId` method may be failing to find existing records due to:
   - Column doesn't exist yet (migration not run)
   - Query error being caught and returning null
   - Race condition between multiple requests

2. **Infinite Recursion**: The `findOrCreateByMuxAsset` method calls itself indirectly through `createWithFallback`, creating a loop

3. **Error Handling**: Errors in the database layer are being caught but not properly handled, causing retries

## Immediate Fix Required

The upload route is calling `VideoDB.findOrCreateByMuxAsset()` which has flawed logic that can cause infinite loops.

## Solution

1. **Add Circuit Breaker**: Prevent infinite loops with request tracking
2. **Fix Database Query**: Ensure proper error handling in `findByMuxAssetId`
3. **Simplify Logic**: Remove recursive calls in duplicate prevention
4. **Add Logging**: Better visibility into what's happening

## Files to Fix

1. `src/lib/database.ts` - Fix the `findOrCreateByMuxAsset` method
2. `src/app/api/videos/upload/route.ts` - Add circuit breaker logic
3. Add request tracking to prevent infinite loops

## Priority: CRITICAL - Server is unusable due to infinite loop
